Date Ariane Game Engine
======
This engine is a HTML5/JavaScript based game engine mainly focused to support the dating game "Date Ariane".
I just added the very first scenes of the game where you getting introduced to ariane, your date. I am planning to slowly port the entire game to this new improved engine, because I really like the original project but thought that the old system, on which the game is based, could be improved and enhanced.

If you like to use this engine for your own dating game, feel free to clone this repo and just strip the game scenes and actions scripts files.
